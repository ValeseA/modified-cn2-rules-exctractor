# Modified Descriptive CN2

A project for rule extraction and classification using combined concepts and rule-based reclustering approaches.
Code based on the CN2 algorithm, modified to extract descriptive logical rules from data.

## Description

This project combines rule extraction techniques with semantic clustering to improve data classification and interpretation. It is organized into three main modules:
- **Rules Extraction**: Generates descriptive rules from datasets.
- **Concepts Combination**: Combines concepts using an ontology.
- **Reclassification**: Reclusters rules with probabilistic methods.

## Main Features

- Rule extraction from musical datasets.
- Combination and management of semantic ontologies.
- Visualization of results and reclustering analysis.

## Usage

Example to run the rule extraction module, inside the "Rules Extraction" folder:
```bash
python gtzan_rules.py
```

## Folder Structure

- **Concepts Combination**: Manages concept combinations.
- **Rules Extraction**: Contains scripts to generate and evaluate rules.
- **Reclassification**: Contains scripts for rule reanalysis.
